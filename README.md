# 👋 Hi, I’m Sayed Ibrahim

- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack web development, creating user-friendly interfaces, and automating boring tasks using Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), along with Python and Django.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly open source projects, especially those using JavaScript or Python frameworks.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love turning ideas into real applications—and breaking things just to learn how to fix them better!
